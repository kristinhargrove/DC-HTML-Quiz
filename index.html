    <h1>Digital Crafts Pop Quiz</h1>

    <p class = "content">I personally love chocolate cookie, not croissant. I also like pizza, dark chocolate peanut butter cups, ice cream (cookie dough), milkshakes, and potato chips. Salt and Vinegar is my favorite flavor, and actually, really the only flavor that I will eat. When I am feeling extra splurgy on food I will get Reese Cups filled with Reese Pieces and cookie dough ice cream and eat it all together with whipped cream. I am trying not to eat sugar for a while so I haven't had that decadent treat in a bit, but I will soon because now I am thinking about it. </p>
